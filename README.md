# ixy-ci

A CI service to test the [ixy userspace network driver](https://github.com/emmericp/ixy) and its
[derivatives](https://github.com/ixy-languages). The basic idea is to spawn three independent VMs which
take on the following roles:

- `pktgen` pushes network packets (with sequence numbers) into network 1
- `fwd` forwards all packets from network 1 to network 2
- `pcap` captures packets from network 2

With this setup we can simultaneously test three applications and make sure that the whole scenario
works correctly by inspecting the captured packets from `pcap`.

Currently only tests the Virtio driver. Testing the ixgbe driver is planned but requires
infrastructure changes.

While ixy-ci does make sure that the build finishes correctly, you still may want to use ixy-ci in
conjunction with traditional CI services to check builds across a larger variety of OS environments
or to check things like formatting/linting.

## What is currently being checked?
- Correct amount of packets captured
- Sanity check of the largest received sequence number (between `n_pcap` and `2 * n_pcap`)
- No duplicate packets received

## How to test a new repository with ixy-ci
To use ixy-ci you only need to follow these instructions:
- Create a GitHub webhook for your repository (in your repository settings)
    - URL: `https://ci.ixy.rs/github/webhook`
    - Content type: `application/json`
    - Secret (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48`); make sure to save this somewhere
    - Events: Issue comments & Pushes
- Securely send your webhook secret to your ixy-ci administrator
- Open a PR adding a `ixy-ci.toml` to your repository (see `ixy-ci.toml.example` for reference)
- Also make sure that your applications match the expected command line interface as described below
- Comment `@ixy-ci test` in your PR until the tests pass :)

### Required command line interface of applications
- `pktgen <pci addr>`
- `fwd <pci addr src> <pci addr dst>`
- `pcap <pci addr> <pcap output file> <stop after n packets>`

The packets that are generated by `pktgen` are expected to follow the same structure and size as
in the [ixy pktgen example](https://github.com/emmericp/ixy/blob/master/src/app/ixy-pktgen.c).

## ixy-ci setup instructions
These instructions are only needed when you want to deploy your own instance of ixy-ci.

### OpenStack
- ixy-ci assumes a dedicated OpenStack project with no other users.
- Network `pktgen-fwd`
    - Port `pktgen`
    - Port `fwd-in`
- Network `fwd-pcap`
    - Port `fwd-out`
    - Port `pcap`
- Networks require a subnet for port creation/attachment to succeed (disable DHCP)
    - This may be incorrect since it seems to work without a subnet throught the `openstack` CLI
- Disable "Port Security" on all ports
- Create a keypair for ixy-ci to SSH into the spawned VMs

### `config.toml`
See config.toml.example for the general format of the `config.toml`. The OpenStack login information
can be extracted from a generated `clouds.yaml`. The only additional information you have to
manually query is the _project domain_. You can do that like this:
```sh
# First retrieve the domain id
openstack --os-cloud openstack project show <project_name>
# Then retrieve the actual domain name
openstack --os-cloud openstack domain show <domain_id>
```

### OpenStack CLI
Currently ixy-ci requires that the OpenStack CLI is available due to missing APIs in the openstack
crate.

### GitHub bot account
ixy-ci requires a GitHub account to post results and to interact with the GitHub API. Any account
should work though we advise to use a dedicated bot account. You need to create a _personal access
token_ (GitHub / Setting / Developer settings) with access to the `public_repo` scope.

### Deploy with Docker

```
make # Ctrl+C once running
docker build . -t ixy-ci
docker volume create ixy-ci-config
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /var/lib/docker/volumes/ixy-ci-config/_data/
cp config.toml.example /var/lib/docker/volumes/ixy-ci-config/_data/config.toml
docker run --mount source=ixy-ci-config,target=/config -p 127.0.0.1:9999:8080 --restart always -d --name ixy-ci ixy-ci
```

## MicroStack
For local development you can use [MicroStack](https://microstack.run/) which deploys OpenStack
on your machine. (in a snap so without affecting the rest of your system too much)

Here are complete instructions for getting up and running:
```
# Setup MicroStack
sudo snap install microstack --devmode --beta
sudo microstack.init --auto --control
# Get password for "admin"; Web UI is at http://10.20.20.1
sudo snap get microstack config.credentials.keystone-password

# Import Debian 10 image
wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current-10/debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2
microstack.openstack image create --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 --file debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2 debian-10-openstack-amd64
rm debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2

# Create virtual networks
microstack.openstack network create pktgen-fwd --disable-port-security
microstack.openstack port create pktgen --network pktgen-fwd
microstack.openstack port create fwd-in --network pktgen-fwd

microstack.openstack network create fwd-pcap --disable-port-security
microstack.openstack port create fwd-out --network fwd-pcap
microstack.openstack port create pcap --network fwd-pcap

# Import SSH public key
microstack.openstack keypair create ixy-ci --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Adjust config.toml:
# Set the openstack password (see command above)
# Set the GitHub API token
# Adjust the path to the SSH private key

# After a reboot you can start MicroStack again with:
sudo snap start microstack

# Remove MicroStack again when you're done
sudo snap remove microstack --purge
# Restart computer to also get rid of left over virtual interfaces etc.
```

## TODO
- Only allow configured users to start tests (to prevent abuse)
- Do more stuff concurrently once async/await is ready (also trussh instead of libssh2)
- Fix issue where ixy-ci cannot be terminated via ctrl+c after a message has been posted on GitHub
  (related: graceful shutdown?)
- Code documentation
- Track down why OpenStack project domain is required (although OpenStack CLI doesn't need it)

## Future feature plans
- Test on master branch push (+ cronjob?) => endpoint for badges which redirect to shields.io
- Dashboard with status about current job, queue, past results
- Test ixgbe driver somehow (SR-IOV, pci passthrough?)
- Integration with GitHub checks API
